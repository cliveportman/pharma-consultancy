# Pharma consultancy
*FORMER CLIENT PROJECT - when I joined my current employer, I handed over this client to another team.*

A content-managed site for a pharmaceutical consultancy company. Developed in collaboration with https://specialdesignstudio.com/ for a client in the pharmaceutical industry.

## Project aims
Something more appealing than your typical pharma site. The client wanted a site that was clean, modern, and easy to navigate. They also wanted to be able to update the site themselves, so we built it with a CMS. The project was developed and supported for several years before I went for a change of career.

## What does it show?
- Working directly with stakeholders
- Full-stack web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP)
- Integration with third-party APIs
- Delivering tightly to a design spec, while adding value through animations and transitions

### Frontend
Svelte JS hosted and deployed via Netlify using lambda functions for sending emails via Sendgrid (later updated to Mailgun).

### Backend
Craft CMS for content-management (delivered via GraphQL), a Linode server for hosting and Laravel Forge for deployment.

## Who was the client?
A pharmaceutical consultancy company based in Cambridge, UK. We were recommended by previous clients, initially working with the directors and then with their operations team.

## Technical challenges
Designing something for the pharamaceutical industry that didn't look staid and corporate, while also not looking like a Wordpress template, was the main challenge. I worked closely with the client and the designer to ensure the site was both visually appealing and easy to navigate.

Integrating the video on the homepage required some finesse to deliver it perfectly across a range of devices.
